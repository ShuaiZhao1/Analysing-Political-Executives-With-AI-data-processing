# Overview of Notebooks

These notebooks are included to illustrate a hypothetical Machine Learning project created following best practices.

The goal of this ML project is to predict the heat capacity of inorganic materials given the chemical composition and condition (the measurement temperature).
We will use both classical ML models as well as neural networks.

To do this, we must: 
1. Clean and process our dataset, removing obviously erroneous or empty values. 
1. Partition our data into train, validation, and test splits. 
1. Featurize our data, turning the chemical formulae into CBFVs.
1. Train models on our data and assess the predictive power of the models.
1. Compare the performance of the models fairly and reproducibly.
1. Visualize the prediction results of the models.
1. Share our models and enable others to reproduce your work and aid collaboration.
